Blueprints to C++ - Episode 1 : Starting a Project - Part 1
---------------------------------------------------------------

In this Video i will create a unreal engine 4 c++ project that will be continiously used in the whole series with new 
features added to each new episode. I will briefly cover some unreal editor settings for setting the c++ IDE of
your choice and start creating a blueprint version of a small example that will then be later converted
into a c++ base class. Based on that example i will show how to best create c++ classes and start 
recreating the example blueprint script into c++, beginning with creating a c++ Actor class, adding a
Static Mesh component to it, creating a blueprint class that inherits from our c++ class, setting the
static mesh and placing that script into the scene. The upcoming second part will then continue converting the
blueprint visual script that we created into c++.


Blueprints to C++ - Episode 1 : Starting a Project - Part 2
---------------------------------------------------------------

In Part 2 of this two part Episode 1 video, we will continue were we left of, by adding variables
to the c++ Actor class we created in the first video and implementing the functionality from the 
example blueprint script in it's BeginPlay and Tick Function. Step by step we recreate the blueprint
version in c++ while also covering topics like unreal naming and code structure conventions while 
doing so. At the end of the video there is a Recap of what we did and a tip of the day showing a 
different approach using booleans in the c++ class. This is an approach the Epic is using in the 
unreal engine c++ game framework intensively, because it better compacts the memory layout. So look 
forward to it at the end of the video.
