UE4 - Blueprints to C++ Episode 9 - UEnum Basics. 
This video will cover the basics of UEnums in Unreal and how to create them with the UE4 C++ Game Framework. It shows 4 different variants on how to create enums, to the Tip of the Day where it shows how to display the enums display and value name. 
First the video will start with an intro and outline of the video and then dive right into creating a new UEnum in the UE4 Editor and implementing the base code in C++ in the IDE. It shows how to use the UENUM Macro, which is similar the the UCLASS Macro defined in the UE4 C++ 
Game Framework to create the first of the four variants. Adding Values to it, defining a UProperty in the AConeActor class from previous videos and testing it in a small example. The next part will cover a second variant using a namespace technique that is found throughout the whole UE4 c++ Game framework.
After that the video go into creating the most commonly used enum type based on class enums, that don't require the TEnumAsByte definition, like the first two variants do. And will finish with the fourth variant which are bitflag enums, where it will show how to create
bitflag enums, create UProperties that can hold many values of that enum type, explain how to add , remove and check for bitflag values. And in the Tip of the day which will conclude the video, it will show how to display the value or display name of a UEnum.
