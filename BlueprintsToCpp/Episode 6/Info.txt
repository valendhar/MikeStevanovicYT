UE4 - Blueprints to C++ Episode 6 - TSet Basics. 
This short video will cover the basics of the TSet from UE4 C++ Game Framework, from function comparison with blueprint and the different iteration types you can do in unreal c++. First the video will start with an intro and outline of the video and then dive right into the comparison of TSet UE4 Blueprint and C++ function names and calls.

It covers the most important blueprint function calls like Add, Add Items, Length, Contains, To Array, Remove Item, Remove Items and clear, and shows how to call these functions with c++. The TSet which is part of the Core UE4 C++ Game Framework, has some other naming conventions, or some functions are not called the same as in Blueprint. So the video will then compare TSet functions in Blueprints and C++ and show the differences in naming, and which functions don't even exist in C++.

After going through the functions, the video will cover all the different Iteration Types that are possible in UE4 C++, and shows how to use these iteration types with the TSet. It will cover types , like the standard for loop, range based loops and also how to use Iterators in a for loop to iterate over the set. Then at the end in the outro it is mentioned that the next video of the UE4 Blueprints to C++ Programming series will be similar like this video and will cover the TMap collection class.
