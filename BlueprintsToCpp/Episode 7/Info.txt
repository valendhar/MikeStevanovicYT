UE4 - Blueprints to C++ Episode 7 - TMap Basics. 
This short video will cover the basics of the TMap from the UE4 C++ Game Framework, from function comparison with blueprint and the different iteration types you can do in unreal c++. First the video will start with an intro and outline of the video and then dives right into the comparison of TMap UE4 Blueprint and C++ function names and calls.

It covers the most important blueprint function calls like Add, Length, Contains, Keys, Values, Find, Remove Item and clear, and shows how to call these functions with c++. The TMap which is part of the Core UE4 C++ Game Framework, has some other naming conventions, or some functions are not called the same as in Blueprint. So the video will then compare TMap functions in Blueprints and C++ and show the differences in naming, and which functions don't even exist in C++.

After going through the functions, the video will cover all the different Iteration Types that are possible in UE4 C++, and shows how to use these iteration types with the TMap. It will cover types , like the standard for loop, range based loops and also how to use Iterators in a for loop to iterate over the TMap. In the tip of the day the video will cover the Find function of a TMap 
that has a pointer Type as a value. It goes through in an example on how to get all actors of a specific type in a scene, then adds all these to the map, and then shows how to derefence a Pointer to a Class Pointer. It also mentions the UGameplayStatics Function library, which
is a real important library in the UE4 C++ Game Framework with lots of functionalities. Then at the end in the outro it is mentioned that the next video of the UE4 Blueprints to C++ Programming series will be similar like this video and will cover the TMap collection class.
