This video covers UFUNCTIONS in detail in Unreal c++. How it's declared, how to set specifiers and meta tags.
The video goes through all important UFUNCTION Specifiers, like BlueprintCallable, BlueprintPure, 
BlueprintImplementableEvent BlueprintNativeEvent and Category with detailed examples of each. 
After the specifiers, the most usable meta tags for UFUNCTIONs are described. These are DisplayName, 
Tooltip, ShortTooltip and HidSelfPin. Then the video talks about Function Parameters, when to use references,
const and other posibilities and how these effect how function calls and nodes in blueprint are displayed.
And lastly some general topics are covered like the unreal engine c++ naming conventions for function 
and Shadowed Variables with function parameters and how to prevent shadowed variables errors. And finally the 
tip of the day explains how to use the UPARAM(ref) Macro declared before a function parameter to be able to declare
a non-const reference as an input parameter in blueprints.
