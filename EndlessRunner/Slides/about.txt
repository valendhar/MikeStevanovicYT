This mini series will focus on gameplay mechanics, by creating a basic game prototype using the ue4 c++ game framework.
In this mini series i will show you how to create a basic endless runner prototype from scratch in ue4 c++. The focus of
this series lies more on showing how to code in Unreal Engine 4 with c++ rather then creating a full endless runner game.
Because of that we are not starting with any build in templates, like the 3rd person template, but create every little detail
from scratch. This mini series will start by creating the project and setting it up, then setting up a character with animations 
from scratch. After that you will create and an endless floor tile system with lane switching and add features like Obstacles and 
Coin Collection system. After that you will Create a Main Menu, Pause and Game Over menu system and add a death and live system.
The Ue4 c++ Gameframework features that will be taught in this series are:
Creating Actors and Components , Overriding Parent Functions, Spawning Actors, using TSubclassOf to define Blueprint classes that 
can be Instantiated in C++, Creating a Character Animation Blueprint with a C++ base, Input handling and collision handling in ue4 c++, 
creating Event Handling with Custom Multicast Events and using c++ timers. Also Custom UMG UserWidgets , Widget Bindings and UI Event Handling
will be explained as well as the ue4 c++ Game Framework functions to Pause/ Unpause and Quit the game, and Loading levels.
